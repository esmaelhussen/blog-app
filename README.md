# 📝 React Blog System

A simple yet functional blogging platform built with **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **React Router**, with **localStorage** used to simulate a backend. This project supports user authentication and personal blog post management — making it an excellent learning project for full-stack app structure using front-end only technologies.

## 📖 Description

The **React Blog System** allows users to register, log in, and manage their own blog posts. It simulates backend functionality using `localStorage`, meaning all user and blog data persists in the browser without requiring an external server.

This project helps learners understand:

- Authentication flow (register, login, logout)
- Protected routes based on login status
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- React state and Context API
- Routing with React Router
- Tailwind CSS for UI styling
